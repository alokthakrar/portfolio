<p><strong>Introduction</strong>
The kinetic sculpture is a capstone project that integrates engineering, programming, art, and manufacturing. It uses two revolving discs to create patterns of motion, an effect known as the Moire effect.</p>

<p><strong>CAD + Design</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Modeling:</strong> The sculpture was designed using Solidworks, a parametric modeling software. The process involved building the sculpture from individual components to a complete assembly.</li>
  <li><strong>Moire Discs:</strong> The design of the discs was inspired by the work of David C. Roy. The final design uses two sets of opposite-facing interlocking spokes to create a sense of movement toward the center. The design was sketched in Autodesk Sketchbook and then modeled in Solidworks before being machined on a CNC.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Manufacturing</strong>
The fabrication of the sculptureâ€™s components was divided into two main processes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Lathe:</strong> Spacers, axles, and bearing covers were fabricated on a lathe.</li>
  <li><strong>Mill:</strong> The spacer base mount and vertical base mount were created on a mill.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Controls and Assembly</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Electronics:</strong> The project involved extensive soldering to connect components, including a custom PCB. The sculpture is controlled by an Arduino.</li>
  <li><strong>Assembly:</strong> The sculpture was assembled in sub-assemblies to streamline the process. An arbor press was used to push axles into bearings.</li>
  <li><strong>Programming:</strong> The programming was done in C++ using the Arduino IDE. The sculpture has three switches, allowing for up to eight different programmatic patterns. A key feature is a reversal function that uses a tachometer and an ultrasonic sensor to return the disc to its original position.</li>
</ul>
